```

## Building

To build the library, run:

```bash
ng build lib
```

This command will compile your project, and the build artifacts will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

### Publishing the Library

Once the project is built, you can publish your library by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the `dist` directory:
   ```bash
   cd dist/lib
   ```

2. Run the `npm publish` command to publish your library to the npm registry:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
